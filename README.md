# Shopping List

Hosting Link: https://williams439.github.io/2024-mar-shopping-list/

This is my capstone project for the Quickstart Coding bootcamp. The purpose of this project is to display what I have learned over the course of this program.

The objective of the project is to create a shopping list application that allows users to easily add and delete items that they intend to purchase.

Items contain

- Item name
- Quantity
- Button to remove
